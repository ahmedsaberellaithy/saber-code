# Saber Code CLI

Saber Code CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that helps developers generate boilerplate code for their projects. It uses a simple configuration file to define the code templates and the files to be generated. The user can specify the template to use, the output directory, and any additional options.

The CLI provides several capabilities, including:

* Analyze code and suggest improvements
* Edit files (create, update, replace content)
* Provide project summaries
* Search for code patterns
* Explain code functionality
* Remember project context from previous sessions

The CLI is designed to be easy to use and requires minimal setup. Simply download the binary for your operating system and run it with the appropriate command-line arguments.
